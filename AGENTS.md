# Baidu Ads project instructions

- Read README.md and docs/DATA.md before changing data publication.
- This repository and GitHub Pages site are public. Never commit `.credentials.json`, `.backup-key`, visitor IP addresses, raw SQLite/CSV files, or `work/`.
- Preserve raw data through `scripts/vault.py`; use authenticated encryption and keep the key in repository Secrets or a private recovery file.
- Public data must be produced by `scripts/publish_data.py`; do not copy the private SQLite database into `data/`.
- Keep source keywords, search terms, campaign names and existing ad copy unchanged when translating UI text.
- Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `python scripts/verify_data.py`, and `python scripts/check_public.py` before publishing data changes.
- Do not enable automatic bid, budget, keyword or campaign mutations. The collector intentionally has a read-only endpoint allowlist.
- The UI uses `dashboard.template.html`, `i18n.en.json` and `i18n.py`; regenerate both languages with `python dashboard.py --public` for Pages.
- All setup scripts must be relative to the checkout, not tied to one user's home directory.
